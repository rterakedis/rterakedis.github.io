## Background

Last year, my wife introduced me to an entirely foreign-to-me concept of journaling known as [Bullet Journaling](https://youtu.be/fm15cmYU0IM).  For those of you unintiated, think of bullet journaling as an extensible planner with a heavy focus on the index to help bring order to chaos.  A bullet journal is meant to be flexible, allowing you to organize tasks, events, collections (groups of tasks, ideas, etc), and more.   Bullet Journaling was basically born of a need to bring all the ideas/tasks/etc plauging us in the digital age and put them to paper in a single place.  By doing so, there was less chance of forgetting things, and the repetition of writing helped bring mindfulness to the list.

## Bullet Journaling Basics

A basic bullet journal consists of an Index, Future Logs, Monthly Logs, Daily Logs, and Collections. As you start a Bullet Journal, you first set up the Future Logs and add their page numbers to the Index.  Next, you start the Monthly Log to capture all the things you need to do that month and the time you have to accomplish them. Finally, you start your Daily logs which is the list of entries (tasks, events, and notes) you curate day-to-day via rapid logging (short bulleted sentences).

The beauty of the bullet journal is that each time you review (adding, completing or moving) items, you bring mindfulness of your tasks at hand and iterate on the need to keep the remaining entries.  This also allows you to review when entries need moved (perhaps to a new month) or deleted as no longer worth your time.
