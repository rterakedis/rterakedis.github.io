&lt;p>Sudden panic set in as I walked by my child's room and heard the lyric from &lt;em>Monsters&lt;/em> by &lt;em>All Time Low&lt;/em> -- &amp;quot;I don't mind while you f**k up my life&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, I just had the realization that the critical parental controls on the Homepod Mini's in my children's rooms were no longer working as intended. This set off a multi-hour troubleshooting session, with some involvement from AppleCare, that got things working until it didn't (again). As it usually goes, &amp;quot;It Just Works&amp;quot;... until it doesn't.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Apple's Missing Hardware - A KVM Switch</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/apples-missing-hardware-kvm-switch/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Nov 2022 15:40:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/apples-missing-hardware-kvm-switch/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Let me start by saying that I'm assuming many of you out there are in a situation quite similar to my own. This situation; having a personal Mac &lt;em>and&lt;/em> a work Mac (and maybe an iPad Pro thrown into that mix also). But if you're also like me, you have limited space on your desk and don't want to be surrounded by monitors! This leads me to my most potent complaint about Apple hardware; the lack of a KVM switch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ensuring Domain Name Survival</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/ensuring-domain-name-survival/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 21:54:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/ensuring-domain-name-survival/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I was listening to the &lt;a href="https://twit.tv/posts/transcripts/security-now-episode-885-transcript">Security Now Podcast&lt;/a> the other day, and a GREAT topic came up that I wanted to write about. That topic, as covered by Leo and Steve, involves ownership (specifically registrants) of Domain Name System (DNS) records. I know from past experience, domain &amp;quot;ownership&amp;quot; never seems to be front-of-mind for many folks deciding to start a website. Whether you're simply looking to blog, or starting a new business, the focus tends to be on the outcome (&amp;quot;I have a new website&amp;quot;) than the path to get there. In this article, I want to cover some of the common ways domains are registered and how you can protect your domain name should something ever happen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Job in the Privacy Industry at OneTrust</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/new-job-industry-privacy-onetrust-copy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 21:54:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/new-job-industry-privacy-onetrust-copy/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Lots of changes afoot in my professional life. This past February, I joined the ranks of many folks in the &lt;em>Great Resignation&lt;/em> and made a career shift.

&lt;p>Since Workspace ONE UEM version 9.3, VMware has included the open-source &lt;a href="https://github.com/munki/munki">munki&lt;/a> binaries in the Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub for macOS. The intent of this integration was to give macOS admins the ability to distribute 3rd-party non-store macOS apps, without the need to host any backing instrastructure for munki. Because this integration was meant to give admins some of the commonly used functionality, it was not integrated in such a way to include support for ALL munki's functionality. This has left some confusion in the community, particularly with Workspace ONE UEM administrators with extensive munki knowledge/background.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Best Practices for Apple Admins in Workspace ONE UEM</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/best-practices-for-apple-admins-in-workspace-one-uem/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/best-practices-for-apple-admins-in-workspace-one-uem/</guid><description>

Branching, merging, commits... all the buzzwords I remember from my early days dealing with Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Subversion. Admittedly, I never felt like I spent the time required to understand how it all worked. Fast forward to mid-2017, when a group of us within VMware needed to share some of our tips and tricks with the broader VMware community. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/vmware-samples/euc-samples">EUC-Samples&lt;/a> repository was born on GitHub, and my journey like Alice down the rabbit hole began.

This script/tool is solid, but I was really hoping to be able to just do the updates using softwareupdate. Awhile back I filed feedback with Apple to the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The --fetch-full-installer parameter for the softwareupdate command line tool is awesome, but there's currently no way to discover the list of available values for the --full-installer-version parameter. Can you please add a --list-installer-versions parameter (or something to that effect) that would show the list of available full installer versions that softwareupdate can download? My understanding is the installer versions relate to the product marketing version (like 11.0, or 10.15.7), but as those versions are added/removed it would be nice easily discover that from the command line.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Another GitHub Actions Update - Using Deploy Keys Instead Of Personal Access Tokens</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/another-github-actions-update-change-hugo-publish-deploy-keys/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/another-github-actions-update-change-hugo-publish-deploy-keys/</guid><description>

For those of you uninitiated, think of bullet journaling as an extensible planner with a heavy focus on the index to help bring order to chaos. A bullet journal is flexible, allowing you to organize tasks, events, collections (groups of tasks, ideas, and more). Bullet Journaling was born of a need to bring all the ideas/tasks/events plaguing us in the digital age and put them to paper in a single place. By doing so, there was less chance of forgetting things, and the repetition of writing helped bring mindfulness to the list.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying Microsoft Defender ATP for macOS using Workspace ONE UEM</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/2020-02-18-Deploying-Microsoft-ATP-Defender-for-Mac-using-Workspace-One/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/2020-02-18-Deploying-Microsoft-ATP-Defender-for-Mac-using-Workspace-One/</guid><description>

Once I was able to parse through the Jamf/InTune documentation, we were able to put together some guidance.

&lt;p>Working at VMware, I'm surrounded by great technology and super-smart folks! In our portfolio of technologies, the folks in our R&amp;amp;D have recently been putting quite a bit of effort into building out macOS capabilities for our Workspace ONE Tunnel client for macOS. Workspace ONE admins can leverage the same VMware technology they used to enable per-app VPN for iOS and Android, but now on macOS! There's a bit of nuance to configuring the VPN client if you're previously familiar with iOS (look for my Operational Tutorial soon to hit &lt;a href="https://techzone.vmware.com">TechZone&lt;/a>). That said, the premise is the same -- by configuring the appropriate rules, the Tunnel app redirects traffic from whitelisted applications back into your network through the Unified Access Gateway.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome to Hugo (from Jekyll)</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/2018-06-15-welcome-to-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/2018-06-15-welcome-to-jekyll/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Welcome to my wholly reworked website! This time, I've dropped the complexity of Wordpress and opted for something significantly simpler: &lt;del>Jekyll&lt;/del> Hugo and GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having now hosted the site in GitHub Pages, here was the process I started with Hugo:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Created the Github Pages repo (rterakedis.github.io) -- this is where github pages looks for the blog's generated site files.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Created a 2nd Github repo: rterakedis.github.io.hugo -- this repo holds the source files for Hugo to parse and generate the site.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added the GH Pages repo (rterakedis.github.io) as a submodule for rterakedis.github.io.hugo&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Edited the config.toml in the hugo files to include the following:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>baseURL = &amp;quot;https://blog.euc-rt.me/&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>publishdir = &amp;quot;rterakedis.github.io&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Add the CNAME file into the rterakedis.github.io repo and enable the custom name/https in the repo settings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ensure the output from &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> builds into the rterakedis.github.io directory in my local rterakedis.github.io.hugo directory&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Commit and push everything to GitHub&lt;/li>
