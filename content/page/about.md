My name is Robert Terakedis.  I'm a Microsoft-based datacenter engineer turned Senior Technical Marketing Architect at VMware.  Apple mobility management is my jam.  Workspace ONE UEM is my bread & butter.

More specifically, I've been in the Tech industry since 2002.  I've held various roles spanning Microsoft-platform datacenter support and engineering (Exchange, Hyper-V infrastructure, Citrix, etc).  In 2014, I moved into a new role dealing with Apple device management in the Enterprise.  I enjoy my job, I find science and technology fascinating, and I'm thankful for every day I get to show up to work at [VMware](http://www.vmware.com).  As I've jokingly (but not so much) mentioned to my boss, if I can wear jeans and a hoodie 24/7, I'm all-in.  

Honestly, you can get more specifics on my [Linked-In profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/terakedis/).
