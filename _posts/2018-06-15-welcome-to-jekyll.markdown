Welcome to my completely reworked website!  This time, I've dropped the complexity of Wordpress and opted for something significantly simpler:  Jekyll and GitHub.  

A few quick links that I found particularly helpful:
* [How I'm using Jekyll in 2016](https://mademistakes.com/articles/using-jekyll-2016/#fn-2)
* [Secure & Fast Github pages with CloudFlare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/)
* [Utterances - Blog Commenting using GitHub Issues](https://utteranc.es/)
