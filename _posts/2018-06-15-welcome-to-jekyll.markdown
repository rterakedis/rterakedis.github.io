Welcome to my completely reworked website!  This time, I've dropped the complexity of Wordpress and opted for something significantly simpler:  Jekyll.  Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

As I find fun new topics to blog about, I'll be sure to include them here for the benefit of everyone.
