Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.  Got tired of trying to maintain Wordpress/Plugins and just wanted something where I could put out random blog posts about technology stuff when I have time.
