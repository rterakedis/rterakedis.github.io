      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going back and forth with Apple about some of the issues I previously found using the macOS Catalina Kerberos SSO over Per-App VPN. As it turns out, they acknowledged some of the issues I was seeing and are supposedly working on a fix. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching the past few beta releases for macOS, and I&amp;rsquo;ve not yet seen anything in the release notes to indicate they&amp;rsquo;ve implemented any fixes.</description>

      <description>Background Last year, my wife introduced me to an entirely foreign-to-me concept of journaling known as Bullet Journaling. For those of you uninitiated, think of bullet journaling as an extensible planner with a heavy focus on the index to help bring order to chaos. A bullet journal is flexible, allowing you to organize tasks, events, collections (groups of tasks, ideas, and more). Bullet Journaling was born of a need to bring all the ideas/tasks/events plaguing us in the digital age and put them to paper in a single place.</description>

      <title>Deploying Microsoft Defender ATP for macOS using Workspace ONE UEM</title>

      <description>I had a few folks recently approach me on the MacAdmins slack asking for help with deploying Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac. We got it working, but it came down to 2 issues: conflicting documentation and Jamf/inTune specific templates. Once I was able to parse through the Jamf/InTune documentation, we were able to put together some guidance. We recently published this guide to the EUC Samples GitHub Repository.
Conflicting Documentation The initial problem I found was some confusion generated by Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s documentation.</description>

      <title>Testing macOS Catalina Kerberos SSO Extension Over VPN</title>

      <description>Working at VMware, I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by great technology and super-smart folks! In our portfolio of technologies, the folks in our R&amp;amp;D have recently been putting quite a bit of effort into building out macOS capabilities for our Workspace ONE Tunnel client for macOS. Workspace ONE admins can leverage the same VMware technology they used to enable per-app VPN for iOS and Android, but now on macOS! There&amp;rsquo;s a bit of nuance to configuring the VPN client if you&amp;rsquo;re previously familiar with iOS (look for my Operational Tutorial soon to hit TechZone).</description>

      <title>Welcome to Hugo (from Jekyll)</title>

      <description>Welcome to my wholly reworked website! This time, I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped the complexity of Wordpress and opted for something significantly simpler: Jekyll Hugo and GitHub.
Having now hosted the site in GitHub Pages, here was the process I started with Hugo:
 Created the Github Pages repo (rterakedis.github.io) &amp;ndash; this is where github pages looks for the blog&amp;rsquo;s generated site files. Created a 2nd Github repo: rterakedis.github.io.hugo &amp;ndash; this repo holds the source files for Hugo to parse and generate the site.</description>

      <description>My name is Robert Terakedis. I&amp;rsquo;m a Microsoft-based datacenter engineer turned Senior Technical Marketing Architect at VMware. Apple mobility management is my jam. Workspace ONE UEM is my bread &amp;amp; butter.
More specifically, I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the Tech industry since 2002. I&amp;rsquo;ve held various roles spanning Microsoft-platform datacenter support and engineering (Exchange, Hyper-V infrastructure, Citrix, etc). In 2014, I moved into a new role dealing with Apple device management in the Enterprise.</description>

      <description>One of the most common questions I get is where a device administrator can get started learning about Apple device management with Workspace ONE. More to come on this topic shortly!</description>
