&lt;p>I'm finding myself using the Terminal quite a bit more in my job. I spent a few minutes over the past few days looking at different ways to make the default terminal layout in macOS better. While there are many plugins out there for doing this (&lt;a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">Oh-My-Zsh&lt;/a>), I wanted to do something a little more straightforward.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Armin Briegel has a great article about customizing the zsh prompt in his &lt;a href="https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/">moving to zsh&lt;/a> series. The basics come down to the following - make some changes to the file at &lt;code>~/.zshrc&lt;/code> and then enjoy the fruits of your labor! This file is also where you can add zsh functions (e.g. reusable pieces of code.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Key Added to SoftwareUpdate Command in macOS</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/new-key-added-softwareupdate-command-macos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/new-key-added-softwareupdate-command-macos/</guid><description>

&lt;p>When Big Sur released, I noticed an issue trying to discover what macOS versions were available in SoftwareUpdate. I worked around this by using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/munki/macadmin-scripts/blob/main/installinstallmacos.py">installinstallmacos.py script&lt;/a> to download full installers from the store. This script/tool is solid, but I was really hoping to be able to just do the updates using softwareupdate. Awhile back I filed feedback with Apple to the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The --fetch-full-installer parameter for the softwareupdate command line tool is awesome, but there's currently no way to discover the list of available values for the --full-installer-version parameter. Can you please add a --list-installer-versions parameter (or something to that effect) that would show the list of available full installer versions that softwareupdate can download? My understanding is the installer versions relate to the product marketing version (like 11.0, or 10.15.7), but as those versions are added/removed it would be nice easily discover that from the command line.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
