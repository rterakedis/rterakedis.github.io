&lt;p>Let me start by saying that I'm assuming many of you out there are in a situation quite similar to my own. This situation; having a personal Mac &lt;em>and&lt;/em> a work Mac (and maybe an iPad Pro thrown into that mix also). But if you're also like me, you have limited space on your desk and don't want to be surrounded by monitors! This leads me to my most potent complaint about Apple hardware; the lack of a KVM switch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mapping Concepts from Munki to WS1 UEM</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/mapping-concepts-from-munki-to-workspace-one-uem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/mapping-concepts-from-munki-to-workspace-one-uem/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Since Workspace ONE UEM version 9.3, VMware has included the open-source &lt;a href="https://github.com/munki/munki">munki&lt;/a> binaries in the Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub for macOS. The intent of this integration was to give macOS admins the ability to distribute 3rd-party non-store macOS apps, without the need to host any backing instrastructure for munki. Because this integration was meant to give admins some of the commonly used functionality, it was not integrated in such a way to include support for ALL munki's functionality. This has left some confusion in the community, particularly with Workspace ONE UEM administrators with extensive munki knowledge/background.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Best Practices for Apple Admins in Workspace ONE UEM</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/best-practices-for-apple-admins-in-workspace-one-uem/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/best-practices-for-apple-admins-in-workspace-one-uem/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I was recently reading a post about &lt;a href="https://macostechs.com/2021/05/what-to-do-when-you-have-to-lay-off-your-jamf-administrator/">What to do when you have to lay off your Jamf administrator&lt;/a>, and it got me thinking. The &lt;a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workspace-ONE-UEM/2102/UEM_Recommended_Architecture/GUID-AWT-RECARCH-INTRO.html">Workspace ONE UEM documentation&lt;/a> generally specifies what you &lt;strong>need&lt;/strong> from a software and hardware perspective in pre-requisites. That said, over the years I've come to know a few unwritten (or written but obscure) best practices for setting up Workspace ONE UEM to manage Apple devices. Hopefully you find this post helpful, but I welcome any comments and feedback!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Converting Jamf Custom Schema JSON for Workspace ONE UEM</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/converting-jamf-custom-schema-json-workspace-one-uem/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/converting-jamf-custom-schema-json-workspace-one-uem/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Periodically, I see app vendors providing custom JSON schema files to help build app-specific configuration profiles for MDM (specifically Jamf). Workspace ONE UEM supports app-specific configuration, but currently via &lt;a href="https://github.com/vmware-samples/euc-samples/blob/master/macOS-Samples/CustomXMLProfiles/CustomXMLTemplate.md">Custom Settings in an XML format&lt;/a>. While many vendors also suppply a custom mobileconfig file or Custom Settings dictionary that can be used with Workspace ONE UEM, I hope in this post to show how any Workspace ONE admin can manually convert a Custom Schema JSON file to Custom Settings XML.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Troubleshooting macOS Management with Workspace ONE</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/troubleshooting-macos-management-with-workspace-one/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/troubleshooting-macos-management-with-workspace-one/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Short post today - just to cover some thoughts on my most recent asset published to &lt;a href="https://techzone.vmware.com">TechZone&lt;/a>. I finally sat down and dug out all my notes on troubleshooting macOS and put them all together into a single, comprehensive &lt;a href="https://techzone.vmware.com/troubleshooting-macos-management-vmware-workspace-one-operational-tutorial">macOS Troubleshooting Guide&lt;/a>. This thing was the result of almost 46 hours of fingers on keys: typing, formatting, and testing.

&lt;p>When I restarted my blogging journey last year, I went with Hugo to generate a static website hosted as a GitHub Pages site. As mentioned, Blogger and WordPress always suffered recurring problems, and maintenance with WordPress still turned into a time suck due to its complexity. By comparison, GitHub has been a nearly painless hosting provider, and the way I've configured it has allowed me to keep drafts hidden by staging in a private repository.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying NoMAD over VMware Per-App Tunnel</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/deploying-nomad-over-vmware-per-app-tunnel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/deploying-nomad-over-vmware-per-app-tunnel/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Some folks recently reached out to me asking for help figuring out how to route &lt;a href="https://nomad.menu/support/">NoMAD&lt;/a> traffic over VMware Tunnel. Basically, the ask was to use Per-App Tunneling to give NoMAD the ability to obtain Kerberos Tickets and Sync AD passwords without being directly on the Enterprise network. If you're familiar with my previous article about the &lt;a href="https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/macos-catalina-kerberos-sso-over-vpn-followup/">macOS Catalina Kerberos SSO Plugin&lt;/a>, you'll know that Apple's built-in functionality in Catalina doesn't work well with Per-App Tunneling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modify ZShell Defaults in macOS</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/modify-zshell-defaults/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/modify-zshell-defaults/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I'm finding myself using the Terminal quite a bit more in my job. I spent a few minutes over the past few days looking at different ways to make the default terminal layout in macOS better. While there are many plugins out there for doing this (&lt;a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">Oh-My-Zsh&lt;/a>), I wanted to do something a little more straightforward.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-you-change-zsh-default-layouts">How You Change zsh Default Layouts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Armin Briegel has a great article about customizing the zsh prompt in his &lt;a href="https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/">moving to zsh&lt;/a> series. The basics come down to the following - make some changes to the file at &lt;code>~/.zshrc&lt;/code> and then enjoy the fruits of your labor! This file is also where you can add zsh functions (e.g. reusable pieces of code.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>macOS Big Sur and Kerberos SSO via Per-App Tunnel</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/macos-bigsur-kerberos-sso-over-vpn/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/macos-bigsur-kerberos-sso-over-vpn/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I've been going back and forth with Apple about some of the issues I previously found using the &lt;a href="https://blog.euc-rt.me/2020-02-04-macOS-Catalina-Kerberos-SSO-Over-VPN/">macOS Catalina Kerberos SSO over Per-App VPN&lt;/a>. As it turns out, they acknowledged some of the issues I was seeing and are &lt;em>supposedly&lt;/em> working on a fix.

&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When Big Sur released, I noticed an issue trying to discover what macOS versions were available in SoftwareUpdate. I worked around this by using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/munki/macadmin-scripts/blob/main/installinstallmacos.py">installinstallmacos.py script&lt;/a> to download full installers from the store. This script/tool is solid, but I was really hoping to be able to just do the updates using softwareupdate. Awhile back I filed feedback with Apple to the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The --fetch-full-installer parameter for the softwareupdate command line tool is awesome, but there's currently no way to discover the list of available values for the --full-installer-version parameter. Can you please add a --list-installer-versions parameter (or something to that effect) that would show the list of available full installer versions that softwareupdate can download? My understanding is the installer versions relate to the product marketing version (like 11.0, or 10.15.7), but as those versions are added/removed it would be nice easily discover that from the command line.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying Microsoft Defender ATP for macOS using Workspace ONE UEM</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/2020-02-18-Deploying-Microsoft-ATP-Defender-for-Mac-using-Workspace-One/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/2020-02-18-Deploying-Microsoft-ATP-Defender-for-Mac-using-Workspace-One/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I had a few folks recently approach me on the MacAdmins slack asking for help with deploying Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac. We got it working, but it came down to 2 issues: conflicting documentation and Jamf/inTune specific templates. Once I was able to parse through the Jamf/InTune documentation, we were able to put together some guidance. We recently published this guide to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/vmware-samples/euc-samples/tree/master/macOS-Samples/3rd-Party_Software_Guidance/Microsoft-Defender-ATP">EUC Samples GitHub Repository&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conflicting-documentation">Conflicting Documentation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The initial problem I found was some confusion generated by Microsoft's documentation. The first article, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/mac-preferences">Set Preferences for Microsoft Defender ATP&lt;/a> referenced a payloadType of &lt;code>com.microsoft.wdav&lt;/code>. These preferences seem related to the UI and various configuration settings. In other words, it controls what changes can be made in the UI if opened by the end-user.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Testing macOS Catalina Kerberos SSO Extension Over VPN</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/2020-02-04-macOS-Catalina-Kerberos-SSO-Over-VPN/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/2020-02-04-macOS-Catalina-Kerberos-SSO-Over-VPN/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Working at VMware, I'm surrounded by great technology and super-smart folks! In our portfolio of technologies, the folks in our R&amp;amp;D have recently been putting quite a bit of effort into building out macOS capabilities for our Workspace ONE Tunnel client for macOS. Workspace ONE admins can leverage the same VMware technology they used to enable per-app VPN for iOS and Android, but now on macOS! There's a bit of nuance to configuring the VPN client if you're previously familiar with iOS (look for my Operational Tutorial soon to hit &lt;a href="https://techzone.vmware.com">TechZone&lt;/a>). That said, the premise is the same -- by configuring the appropriate rules, the Tunnel app redirects traffic from whitelisted applications back into your network through the Unified Access Gateway.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
