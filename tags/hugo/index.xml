&lt;p>I was listening to the &lt;a href="https://twit.tv/posts/transcripts/security-now-episode-885-transcript">Security Now Podcast&lt;/a> the other day, and a GREAT topic came up that I wanted to write about. That topic, as covered by Leo and Steve, involves ownership (specifically registrants) of Domain Name System (DNS) records. I know from past experience, domain &amp;quot;ownership&amp;quot; never seems to be front-of-mind for many folks deciding to start a website. Whether you're simply looking to blog, or starting a new business, the focus tends to be on the outcome (&amp;quot;I have a new website&amp;quot;) than the path to get there.

&lt;p>Since I first started this blog, I was using a theme called &lt;a href="https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo">BeautifulHugo&lt;/a>. The theme was great and for the most part visually appealing. However, there were some changes I was hoping to see made to the theme that never really manifested. I had even contributed back some of my own changes, but it appeared the theme had been abandoned by it's creator. I set about looking for a new theme and stumbled onto &lt;a href="https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity">hugo-clarity&lt;/a>. Not only was this theme visually appealing to me, but I could see regular changes being made to the theme. Yes, a theme still under active maintenance!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
