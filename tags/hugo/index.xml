Background Since I first started this blog, I was using a theme called BeautifulHugo. The theme was great and for the most part visually appealing. However, there were some changes I was hoping to see made to the theme that never really manifested. I had even contributed back some of my own changes, but it appeared the theme had been abandoned by it's creator. I set about looking for a new theme and stumbled onto hugo-clarity.</description></item></channel></rss>
