Basically, the ask was to use Per-App Tunneling to give NoMAD the ability to obtain Kerberos Tickets and Sync AD passwords without being directly on the Enterprise network. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with my previous article about the macOS Catalina Kerberos SSO Plugin, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that Apple&amp;rsquo;s built-in functionality in Catalina doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well with Per-App Tunneling.</description></item><item><title>macOS Big Sur and Kerberos SSO via Per-App Tunnel</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/posts/macos-bigsur-kerberos-sso-over-vpn/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/posts/macos-bigsur-kerberos-sso-over-vpn/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve read my blogs about macOS Catalina Kerberos SSO over Per-App Tunnel and the followup, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that this has been a use-case I&amp;rsquo;m interested in solving. I put a great deal of effort into filing feedback with Apple and providing steps to replicate the issue. I was quite excited when I saw the per-app Tunnel improvements specifically mentioned in the WWDC videos, and hoped perhaps some changes were made to enable this functionality.</description></item><item><title>macOS Catalina Kerberos SSO over VPN Followup</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/posts/macos-catalina-kerberos-sso-over-vpn-followup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/posts/macos-catalina-kerberos-sso-over-vpn-followup/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going back and forth with Apple about some of the issues I previously found using the macOS Catalina Kerberos SSO over Per-App VPN. As it turns out, they acknowledged some of the issues I was seeing and are supposedly working on a fix. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching the past few beta releases for macOS, and I&amp;rsquo;ve not yet seen anything in the release notes to indicate they&amp;rsquo;ve implemented any fixes.</description></item><item><title>Testing macOS Catalina Kerberos SSO Extension Over VPN</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/2020-02-04-macos-catalina-kerberos-sso-over-vpn/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/2020-02-04-macos-catalina-kerberos-sso-over-vpn/</guid><description>Working at VMware, I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by great technology and super-smart folks! In our portfolio of technologies, the folks in our R&amp;amp;D have recently been putting quite a bit of effort into building out macOS capabilities for our Workspace ONE Tunnel client for macOS. Workspace ONE admins can leverage the same VMware technology they used to enable per-app VPN for iOS and Android, but now on macOS! There&amp;rsquo;s a bit of nuance to configuring the VPN client if you&amp;rsquo;re previously familiar with iOS (look for my Operational Tutorial soon to hit TechZone).</description></item></channel></rss>
