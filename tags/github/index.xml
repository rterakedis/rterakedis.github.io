Background Since I first started this blog, I was using a theme called BeautifulHugo. The theme was great and for the most part visually appealing. However, there were some changes I was hoping to see made to the theme that never really manifested. I had even contributed back some of my own changes, but it appeared the theme had been abandoned by it's creator. I set about looking for a new theme and stumbled onto hugo-clarity.</description></item><item><title>Great *Free* Resources to Learn GitHub</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/great-free-resources-to-learn-github/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/great-free-resources-to-learn-github/</guid><description>
Background Source control used to be a scary, odd thing for me back in college and early in my career. Branching, merging, commits... all the buzzwords I remember from my early days dealing with Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Subversion. Admittedly, I never felt like I spent the time required to understand how it all worked. Fast forward to mid-2017, when a group of us within VMware needed to share some of our tips and tricks with the broader VMware community.</description></item><item><title>Updated GitHub Actions to Publish Hugo Site From Private to Public Repo</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/updated-github-actions-publish-private-hugo-repo-to-public-pages-site/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/updated-github-actions-publish-private-hugo-repo-to-public-pages-site/</guid><description>
Background When I restarted my blogging journey last year, I went with Hugo to generate a static website hosted as a GitHub Pages site. As mentioned, Blogger and WordPress always suffered recurring problems, and maintenance with WordPress still turned into a time suck due to its complexity. By comparison, GitHub has been a nearly painless hosting provider, and the way I've configured it has allowed me to keep drafts hidden by staging in a private repository.</description></item><item><title>Using GitHub Actions to Publish Hugo Site From Private to Public Repo</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/github-actions-publish-private-hugo-repo-to-public-pages-site/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/github-actions-publish-private-hugo-repo-to-public-pages-site/</guid><description>
Background I restarted my blogging journey earlier this year when I started looking into Jekyll Hugo to generate a static website. I had past experience with Blogger and Wordpress, but frankly had periodic problems with both platforms that ended up being a time suck. As it has been, Hugo has been a simplistic publishing method and GitHub a reliable (and FREE) hosting provider. Yet, my desire to keep my drafts private (.</description></item><item><title>Another GitHub Actions Update - Using Deploy Keys Instead Of Personal Access Tokens</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/another-github-actions-update-change-hugo-publish-deploy-keys/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/another-github-actions-update-change-hugo-publish-deploy-keys/</guid><description>
Background When I restarted my blogging journey in 2020, I switched from Jekyll to Hugo hosted in GitHub pages. It's been a relatively painless journey, and kudos to GitHub as a rock-solid hosting provider. I've covered it before (Initial Setup and First Update), but I've been incredibly happy with private-to-public publishing workflow that allows me to keep drafts and work-in-progress hidden. That said, a recent comment gave me reason to make another update to the Workflow.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to Hugo (from Jekyll)</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/2018-06-15-welcome-to-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/2018-06-15-welcome-to-jekyll/</guid><description>
Welcome to my wholly reworked website! This time, I've dropped the complexity of Wordpress and opted for something significantly simpler: Jekyll Hugo and GitHub.
Having now hosted the site in GitHub Pages, here was the process I started with Hugo:
Created the Github Pages repo (rterakedis.github.io) -- this is where github pages looks for the blog's generated site files. Created a 2nd Github repo: rterakedis.github.io.hugo -- this repo holds the source files for Hugo to parse and generate the site.</description></item></channel></rss>
