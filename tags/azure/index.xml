&lt;p>Two things intersected for me this weekend: Issues with my current lab setup, and realization of some unused credits with my MSDN subscription. This led me down the path of building a basic Azure homelab for Workspace ONE UEM testing. My intent of this blog post is to document the process for myself to re-use, but I also invite your comments on how to improve the scenario. I realize this v1 lab lacks a lot of the frills (e.g. Availability Zones, redundancy, etc), but I really just wanted to get something stood up to try it out. I also hoped this could provide anyone in the same position a basic blueprint to get started.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
