&lt;p>When I restarted my blogging journey last year, I went with Hugo to generate a static website hosted as a GitHub Pages site. As mentioned, Blogger and WordPress always suffered recurring problems, and maintenance with WordPress still turned into a time suck due to its complexity. By comparison, GitHub has been a nearly painless hosting provider, and the way I've configured it has allowed me to keep drafts hidden by staging in a private repository.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using GitHub Actions to Publish Hugo Site From Private to Public Repo</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/github-actions-publish-private-hugo-repo-to-public-pages-site/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/github-actions-publish-private-hugo-repo-to-public-pages-site/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I restarted my blogging journey earlier this year when I started looking into &lt;del>Jekyll&lt;/del> Hugo to generate a static website. I had past experience with Blogger and Wordpress, but frankly had periodic problems with both platforms that ended up being a time suck. As it has been, Hugo has been a simplistic publishing method and GitHub a reliable (and FREE) hosting provider. Yet, my desire to keep my drafts private (.e.g the use of 2 separate repositories) has created a small overhead in that I have to build and manually commit the website changes to the public repository to make them live.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Another GitHub Actions Update - Using Deploy Keys Instead Of Personal Access Tokens</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/another-github-actions-update-change-hugo-publish-deploy-keys/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/another-github-actions-update-change-hugo-publish-deploy-keys/</guid><description>

&lt;p>When I restarted my blogging journey in 2020, I switched from Jekyll to Hugo hosted in GitHub pages. It's been a relatively painless journey, and kudos to GitHub as a rock-solid hosting provider. I've covered it before (&lt;a href="https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/github-actions-publish-private-hugo-repo-to-public-pages-site/">Initial Setup&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://blog.euc-rt.me/post/updated-github-actions-publish-private-hugo-repo-to-public-pages-site/">First Update&lt;/a>), but I've been incredibly happy with private-to-public publishing workflow that allows me to keep drafts and work-in-progress hidden. That said, a recent comment gave me reason to make another update to the Workflow. Read on for more detail...&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
