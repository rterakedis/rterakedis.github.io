Lots of changes afoot in my professional life. This past February, I joined the ranks of many folks in the Great Resignation and made a career shift. With my new role, I'm working for OneTrust -- a company that creates software to help other companies manage their privacy and regulatory compliance. It's been a total shock to the system --&amp;gt; completely new vocabulary, new verticals, everything. To say I'm feeling impostor syndrome would be an understatement, but I welcome the opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and learn something new.</description></item></channel></rss>
