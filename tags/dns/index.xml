&lt;p>I was listening to the &lt;a href="https://twit.tv/posts/transcripts/security-now-episode-885-transcript">Security Now Podcast&lt;/a> the other day, and a GREAT topic came up that I wanted to write about. That topic, as covered by Leo and Steve, involves ownership (specifically registrants) of Domain Name System (DNS) records. I know from past experience, domain &amp;quot;ownership&amp;quot; never seems to be front-of-mind for many folks deciding to start a website. Whether you're simply looking to blog, or starting a new business, the focus tends to be on the outcome (&amp;quot;I have a new website&amp;quot;) than the path to get there. In this article, I want to cover some of the common ways domains are registered and how you can protect your domain name should something ever happen.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
