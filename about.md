## Hello and welcome!

I decided it was time to freshen up the blog and go for something much simpler.  It had been *so long* since I had blogged, that I decided to simply decomission my old website/blog on Wordpress and switch to [Jekyll with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).  I needed a place to write up some interesting stuff at work in the hopes it can help others!

## What I'm Up To

Here's a recent list of where you'll find me:
* [VMware TechZone](https://techzone.vmware.com/users/robert-terakedis)
