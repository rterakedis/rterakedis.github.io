I'm a Microsoft-based datacenter engineer turned Senior Technical Marketing Architect at VMware turned Product Architect at OneTrust.
More specifically, I've been in the Tech industry since 2002. I've held various roles spanning Microsoft-platform datacenter support and engineering (Exchange, Hyper-V infrastructure, Citrix, etc).

In 2022, I switched gears again and started as a Product Architect at OneTrust.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with Apple Device Management</title><link>https://blog.euc-rt.me/gettingstarted/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.euc-rt.me/gettingstarted/</guid><description>One of the most common questions I get is where a device administrator can get started learning about Apple device management with Workspace ONE.
